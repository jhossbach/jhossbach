I am a German student at the University of Stuttgart, currently working with machine learning models for classification tasks. <br />
I am the author of [python-lsp-ruff](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-ruff), a plugin for `python-lsp-server` that provides linting with `ruff`. <br />
I also contributed to other projects, such as [espresso](https://github.com/espressomd/espresso), a Molecular Dynamics engine written in C++.
